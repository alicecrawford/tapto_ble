TapTo BLE NFC Reader
--------------------
2024 Alice Lutris


A simple DIY BLE NFC reader intended for TapTo ( https://tapto.wiki/Main_Page ).
It uses a PN532 NFC IC module and a CircuitPython compatable microcontroller to
scan cards wirelessly.


Requirements
------------
PN532 NFC reader
Compatable microcontroller: https://circuitpython.org/downloads?features=Bluetooth%2FBTLE
    (I used a Unexpected Maker Feather S3)

CircuitPython for your specific microcontroller

Adafruit CircuitPython libraries:
    adafruit_bus_device
    adafruit_pn532
    adafruit_ble


Making your own
---------------
This step will require a little knowledge of how to work with microcontroller
development boards.

Hook up the PN532 to the microcontroller board.  It can be connected via I2C,
SPI, or UART.  Currently only I2C is tested.  Modify the config.json file
to correspond to the pins that you connect the PN532 to and the interface
used.

Next install CircuitPython and copy over all the libraries into /lib on the
microcontroller; lib should contain the following directories:
    adafruit_bus_device
    adafruit_pn532
    adafruit_ble
    pyndef

(Note: pyndef should be pulled out of the src/ directory in the repo)

Copy the contents of this repo to the root of the microcontroller.

You're all set!  Connect to TapTo (software and instructions coming soon)


What works
----------
This is a work in progress, currently the only things tested are the basic
read interface via I2C.  Writing isn't supported yet, also only NTAG cards are
supported.
